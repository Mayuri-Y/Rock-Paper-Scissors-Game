# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
It seems like you'd like to play a text-based version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I'll describe how the game works, and you can make your choice as the player. I'll then reveal the computer's choice, and we'll determine the winner.

Here are the rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

Please type your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Once you've made your choice, I'll reveal the computer's choice, and we'll see who wins this round!
